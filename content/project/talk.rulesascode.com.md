[talk.RulesAsCode.com](https://talk.rulesascode.com) is a discourse site that I set up with the help of Jameson Dempsey of Legal Hackers. It is a web forum, knowledge base, and mailing list for people working on digitized legislation, regulation, and contract, particularly people doing it in the public sphere.

When I learn about cool tools, I try to remember to add to the knowledge base there.
