Blawx is my tool for demonstrating that it is possible to take declarative logic programming,
which I believe to be the best way to encode legislation, regulation, and contract, and
turn it into a user interface that is approachable for non-programmers.

It is a web app and graphical development environment for the s(CASP) programming language, built in
Google's Blockly tool for graphical development environments. The source code is [avaialable
on GitHub](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx), and a working demonstration is available online at [dev.blawx.com](https://dev.blawx.com).

A very early version of Blawx was also demonstrated in [an article in the MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu).
