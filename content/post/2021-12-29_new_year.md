## Here we go again!

![](/background.png)

In what risks becoming [an annual tradition, around here](/post/roundtablelaw/new-year-new-look-new-flora-2-c06ef3ad16a6/), I've decided to move
the Rules as Code Diary away from Medium into a self-hosted blog built with hugo.

This is mainly motivated by the fact that a lot of what I'm writing these days
is actually code, and Medium is pretty limited in terms of what it can do to
display code typed into the editor. Hugo, on the other hand, will show you
more or less whatever I can type into a markdown document, with syntax
highlighting.

```prolog
oooh(X):-
  look(X),
  prolog_syntax_highlighting(X).
```

```yaml
and:
  - some
  - yaml
```

```python
def and_of_course(it=does):
    return "python"  # too.
```

To get the same effect at Medium I would need to save my code to a gist, and
embed the gist in the medium page, which is a bunch of unnecessary steps.

It also gives me the ability to use headings to build tables of contents, and
use tags to help you find related posts that you might also be interested in,
which you should be able to see on the right.

I'm still learning how to do it, and apart from changing the name and the
background image, it's just using the default theme. I have also not nailed
down exactly _where_ I'm going to host the blog, so thanks for your patience
as these things get sorted out over time. In the meantime, I guess it's
wherever you found it.

Let me know on twitter if you have any problems with it.
