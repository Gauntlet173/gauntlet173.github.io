Blawx is my tool for demonstrating that it is possible to take declarative logic programming,
which I believe to be the best way to encode legislation, regulation, and contract, and
turn it into a user interface that is approachable for non-programmers.

It is a graphical development environment for the Flora-2 programming language, built in
Google's Blockly tool for graphical development environments. The source code is [avaialable
on GitHub](https://github.com/Blawx/blawx), and a working demonstration is available online at [www.blawx.com](https://www.blawx.com).

An early version of Blawx was also demonstrated in [an article in the MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu).

To get started, check out the [beginner's guide in the documentation on the live demo](https://dev.blawx.com/docs/guide).
