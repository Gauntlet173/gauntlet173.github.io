## TL;DR

There is a [new version of Blawx](https://github.com/lexpedite/blawx), [live online](http://dev.blawx.com), that allows you to edit
legislation in [a markdown-like language called Clean](https://github.com/lexpedite/clean).

I will be participating in a conference on Monday on [Rules as Code 2.0](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/rules-as-code-20-global-plenary-tickets-170235006487), looking
at how we generate the skilled workforce that rules as code requires. Registration
is free and highly recommended.

Videos from the SMU Computational Legal Studies conference are [available online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7VkoRLnYYP4ex2vw2t-DABg2UJMdLc5U).

## Blawx Update

I'm working with the Canada School of Public Service on developing Blawx
as a platform for learning projects in the Rules as Code space. We have
recently been discussing the possibility of working with a department on
the drafting of a proposed new regulation from scratch.

Using the previous version of Blawx for that task would have been awkward,
because it did not have any convenient way of allowing you to edit the
legislative text. The legislative text was entered in [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/), an XML specification for legislative and other legal documents. Akoma Ntoso 
is sufficiently difficult to edit in a text editor, that I didn't even
bother creating an interface for doing it in the last version of Blawx.

To make Blawx more useful for this project, we needed a convenient way
to allow the user to edit the legislative text of the rule they are working
on.

A WYSIWYG editor for Akoma Ntoso would be great, but the fact is that most
of the WYSIWYG editors I have seen for Akoma Ntoso are not particularly
user friendly, and none of them are open source. The next best alternative
is a markup language. But the only open source markup language I could find
is [slaw](https://github.com/laws-africa/slaw), which was designed to adhere to an African legislative formatting tradition,
and which generates Akoma Ntoso that Blawx didn't know how to handle.

So I spent some time writing my own minimal markup langauge for encoding
legislation in the Canadian legislative drafting style, called "Canadian
Legal Enactments in Akoma Ntoso", or [clean](https://github.com/lexpedite/clean).

If you are a Python user, it's available at `pip install clean-law`.

The last step was to redesign Blawx to accept Clean input for the legislation,
and allow the user to edit it after it has been created.

That happened last night, and version 1.2.0-alpha is now live.

If you want to input the Rock Paper Scissors Act in the new version Blawx,
here's the Clean code for it:

```text
Rock Paper Scissors Act

Players
1. A game of rock paper scissors has two players.
2. There are three signs:
  (a) Rock,
  (b) Paper, and
  (c) Scissors.

Defeating Relationships
3. The signs are related in the following ways:
  (a) Rock beats Scissors,
  (b) Scissors beats Paper, and
  (c) Paper beats Rock.

Winner
4. The winner of a game is the player who throws
a sign that beats the sign of the other player.
```

I'm hoping it doesn't "feel" like code. But it is.

## Rules as Code 2.0 Conference - Learning Rules as Code

I'm really excited about participating in the AUCLS plenary, [Rules as Code 2.0](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/rules-as-code-20-global-plenary-tickets-170235006487),
on Monday of next week. I'm going to be participating in a panel chaired by
legislative drafter extraordinaire Matthew Waddington, who has been a proponent
for Rules as Code for many years. Our panel will be addressing the question of
how we generate the human resources that a fulsome implementation of Rules as Code
would require.

I'm going to argue that the problem is the tools.
The ideal tool for Rules as Code, with associated learning resources,
will build a community of users at an exponential rate.

For proof, you need look
no further than [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org), which has taken
legal tech by storm, by being free, easier, more law-centric, and better documented
than all the alternatives.

The idea Rules as Code tool is:
* open source
* easy to learn
* easy to use
* easy to deploy
* easy to integrate
* easy to maintain, and
* give high value for initial effort

A small part of that is a technological problem.
If we choose the wrong technologies, technologies that do not "fit" with
how legislation is actually written, 
it is impossible to make them sufficiently easy, particularly with regard
to maintenance.

But in the main, this is a design
problem that hasn't been solved because of the tragedy of expertise and ignorance.

The people that know programming languages don't need the existing tools
to be easier. They don't feel that pain. So they are unmotivated to solve
problems they don't have.

The people that don't know programming languages cannot possibly know the
benefits they are missing out on, or how valuable the missing tools would be.

I live with one foot in both worlds. I have learned enough to understand what
is possible, but for some reason, it has never seemed sufficiently easy. I
wrote Blawx primarily as a way of demonstrating what I know is possible to
people who cannot possibly be expected to recognize it because we just
insist it is so.
