I am a Canadian husband, dad, former lawyer, and computational law expert
specializing in "Rules as Code." I ran my own law firm "Round Table Law"
for nearly a decade until 2020. In 2020 I obtained a Masters degree in
Computational Law from the University of Alberta, and since mid-2020 have
been working full time in the area of applying symbolic, rules-based
artificial intelligence to the task of representing legal knowledge about
statutes, regulations, contracts, and other formally-drafted written rules.

I'm currently the owner and operator of my own consulting firm, Lexpedite
Legal Technology Ltd., and through Lexpedite I am on an interchange with
the Public Health Agency of Canada to act as their Director of Rules as Code.

Previously, I have held the same role at Service Canada's Benefits Modernization
Programme, been the Senior Researcher, Symbolic Artificial Intelligence
for the Singapore Management University Centre for Computational Law,
and a sessional instructor at the University of Alberta teaching law
students how to use Docassemble to automate legal services.

I am also the author of Blawx, and one of the administrators of 
talk.RulesAsCode.com, which you can check out in my Projects page.

My blogging comes in waves. Lots for a few months, nothing for a year.
But it's free, so you get what you pay for.

Thanks for visiting, and stay in touch.
