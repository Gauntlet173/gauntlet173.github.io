I am a Canadian husband, dad, former lawyer, and computational law expert
specializing in "Rules as Code." I ran my own law firm "Round Table Law"
for nearly a decade until 2020. In 2020 I obtained a Masters degree in
Computational Law from the University of Alberta, and since mid-2020 have
been working full time in the area of applying symbolic, rules-based
artificial intelligence to the task of representing legal knowledge about
statutes, regulations, contracts, and other formally-drafted written rules.

I'm currently the owner and operator of my own consulting firm, Lexpedite
Legal Technologies Ltd., and through Lexpedite I am on an interchange with
Service Canada to act as the Director of Rules as Code for their Benefits
Delivery Modernization Programme.

Previously, I have been the Senior Researcher, Symbolic Artificial Intelligence
for the Singapore Management University Centre for Computational Law,
and a sessional instructor at the University of Alberta teaching law
students how to use Docassemble to automate legal services.

I am also the author of Blawx, and one of the administrators of 
talk.RulesAsCode.com, which you can check out in my Projects page.

When I have something to say that doesn't fit in a tweet, I post to my
Rules as Code Diary, which is the main reason for this site.

Thanks for visiting, and stay in touch.
