## The Problem

I made a number of changes to Blawx that makes it possible to
organize your code according to the pieces of the legislation.
This is the first of a number of improvements that are all designed
to let you use Blawx to do a structurally-isomorphic encoding of the
legislation.

The problem was that the initial version did not provide any
good way to edit the Akoma Ntoso source code for the legislation.
Ideally, there would be an open-source WYSIWYG editor for
Akoma Ntoso that was easy to use, and could be integrated with
Blawx. Unfortunately, the only options I could find that were
WYSIWYG were neither open-source NOR easy to use.

The next best thing would be to use an open-source tool that
would allow us to easily generate Akoma Ntoso encodings from
plain text in the way that Markdown is a tool to allow you to
easily generate HTML from plain text.

Unfortunately, the only open source tool I could find for doing
this was slaw, which while excellent, does not expect the text to be formatted in the
style that is usually used in Canada. I might have just added 
Canadian legislation as a format, but it is written in a language and with a library
that I don't have any familiarity with, and it also seems to generate Akoma Ntoso documents in a style that the Blawx
system is not expecting. Valid, but with extra pieces, and
non-standard element types.

So unfortunately, the simplest thing that could possibly work
became writing a new language, and building a tool to parse it and generate Akoma Ntoso from it. Enter "CLEAN."

## CLEAN - Canadian Legal Enactments in Akoma Ntoso

Clean is a combination of a parser for the CLEAN "language",
written using the PyParsing Python library, and some simple
functions that generate Akoma Ntoso from a valid CLEAN file.

The point is to use an intuitive text format, like Markdown,
for people familiar with the style of legislative drafting
used in Canada, that is capable of generate a small but useful subset of
Akoma Ntoso, and which can be easily integrated with Blawx.

### How it Works

If you create a file called `rps.clean` that reads like this:
```text
Rock Paper Scissors Act

Players
1. A game of rock paper scissors has two players.
2. There are three signs:
  (1) Rock,
  (2) Paper, and
  (3) Scissors.

Defeating Relationships
3. The signs have the following relationships:
  (1) Rock beats Scissors,
  (2) Scissors beats Paper, and
  (3) Paper beats Rock.

Winner
4. The winner of a game is the player who throws a sign that beats the sign of the other player.
```

... and if you run this command ...

```bash
python3 clean.py tests/rps.clean
```

... you get the following output ...

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

If you plug that into Blawx, you get an interface for your
code that looks like this:

![](/clean_demo.png)

There are still some bugs. Headers are getting included in
the text of the previous section, but you can see where I'm aiming with it.

## Plans

I'm working on cleaning up the codebase and adding some tests,
after which I'll publish it under the MIT license, so anyone
who wants to can play with it.

Once the bugs are squished, I will be working to integrate it with Blawx so that
you can input and edit your legislative text inside Blawx
using the CLEAN language. Blawx will still be using Akoma
Ntoso in the background, and eventually it will also be a format for import and
export.

I will also be working to expand
the capabilities of CLEAN, as there are a bunch of important
features still missing, like sandwich sections, multi-line
text, paragraphs directly under sections, and a few more.

Once that's done, the immediate priorities for Blawx development
move to taking full advantage of the presence of the legal
document structure by re-implementing defeasibility features,
and finding a way to link the text of the statutes to the
explanations generated by the tool.

I've been working with people at the Canada School of Public
Service who are collaborating with people in a number of
different Canadian federal departments, and that context has
made it a lot easier to figure out what to do next for
Blawx... whatever makes it more useful as a tool for those
projects.
